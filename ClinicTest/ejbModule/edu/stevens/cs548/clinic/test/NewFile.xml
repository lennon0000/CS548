ok
with
what I like to talk about is really I'm
the biggest problems moral I'm not going
to talk about this capital in my mentors
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,808
probably that's also good trace are but
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:36,360
problems moral
and I must say I before I go I'm I
should ask everyone if you try to get
out paper and pen and paper because I'm
actually I ask you to help me
to look at how we do that so get out
your pen and paper bottom line is
there is a lot of problems out there in
the world I'm just gonna lose some of
them there a hundred million people
starving there's a billion people back
clean drinking water
two billion people without sanitation
there are several million people
starting HIV right
the let's go on and on there's to my
mama billion two people who'll be
severely affected by climate change
so on there are many many problems out
there in an ideal world
we would solve the mall but we don't we
don't actually solve all problems
and if we do not the question I think we
need to ask ourselves and that's why it
from the economy session
has to say if we don't do all things we
really have to start asking ourselves
which ones should we saw first and
that's the question i'd like to ask you
if we had safe fifty billion dollars
over the next four years to spend
to do good in this world where should we
spend it we identified
attended the biggest challenges in the
world now just briefly read them climate
change communal seasons complex
education
financial instability governance and
corruption malnutrition and hunger
population migration sanitation water in
subsidies in and trade barriers
we believe these in many ways encompass
the biggest problems in the world
the obvious question would be asked what
do you think are the biggest things
where should we start
on solving these problems but that alone
problem task I was actually the problem
those asked them and office in January
but of course is a problem in asking
people
to focus on problems because we can't
solve problems charlie the biggest
problem we have in the world is a we all
die
but we don't have a technology it also
souter I'm so the point is not to
prioritize
problems but the point is to prioritize
solutions
to problems and that would be have Chris
I get a little more complicated
to climate change have be like Kyoto to
communicable diseases that might be
health clinics a mosquito nets the
complex
to be UN's peacekeeping forces and so on
the point that I would like to ask you
to try to do. has just and 30 seconds I
know there's a man in a Santa
impossible task write down what you
think is probably some the top
priorities
and also and that across where economics
gets evil
to put down what are the things we
should not do first what should be on
the bottom the list please
just take 30 seconds perhaps talk to you
know to your neighbor and just
figure out what should be the top
priorities in bottom prices up the
solutions that we have to the world's
biggest issues
the amazing part in this process and
occurs sorry I would love to I only have
18 minutes %uh my I'm already giving
your credit substantial man my timing I
would love to go into
and get you didn't think about this
process and that's actually what we did
or not
I also strongly encourage you and I'm
sure we'll also have these discussion

59
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:22,066
afterwards

60
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:26,071
to think about how do we actually part
of course you have to ask yourself why

61
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:29,017
on earth was such a list never done
before

62
00:03:29,017 --> 00:03:33,059
and and 11 one reason is that
privatizations incredibly empower

63
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:37,062
uncomfortable nobody wants to do this of
course every organization would love to

64
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:40,127
be in the top up such a list but every
organization would also hate to be not

65
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:41,122
on the top my list

66
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,100
and since there are many more not number
one a spot on the list then there is

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,069
number ones

68
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:50,167
that makes perfect sense not to want to
do such a list we've had the UN from I'm

69
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:52,079
almost 60 years

70
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,114
yet we've never actually made a
fundamentalist a ball that big things

71
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,095
that we can do in the world answer

72
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:01,181
which have them should we do first so it
doesn't mean

73
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:05,840
that we are not prioritizing any
decision as a protestations of course

74
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,250
with still part I think if only
implicitly and that's unlikely to be as

75
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:10,068
good

76
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:13,133
as if we actually did the privatization
and when ima talked about

77
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:18,044
so what I'm proposing is really to say
that we have for a very long time

78
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:21,143
had a situation where we had a menu of
choices them many many things we can do

79
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:22,096
out there

80
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,335
but we not have the prices nor the
sciences

81
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,205
thanks we have not had an idea match in
going into restaurant

82
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,770
and getting this big menu card but you
have no idea what the prices you know

83
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:32,122
you

84
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,251
have a PT have no idea what the prices
it could be a one dollar could be

85
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,070
thousand dollars it could be family size
Peter could be a very individual size

86
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:40,636
petering

87
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,796
we'd like to know these things and that
as with the cover main concerns is a

88
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:45,590
really tried to do

89
00:04:45,059 --> 00:04:48,158
to try to put prices on these issues and
so basically this has been the coming

90
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,077
consensus process

91
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:53,099
we got thirty the world's best economist
3

92
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,103
in each area so we have three the
world's top economist right about

93
00:04:57,003 --> 00:04:59,057
climate change what can we do

94
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:02,125
what will be the cost and what will be
the benefit that likewise Inc

95
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:07,043
communicable diseases 3 the world's TOP
EXPERTS n what can we do what would be

96
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:08,043
the price

97
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:11,099
what should we do about how and what
will be the outcome and so long

98
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,125
then we had some of the world's top
economist Kate a

99
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:19,004
the world's top economists including
three noble Lords meet in Copenhagen

100
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:22,530
in a May 2004 we call them the dream
team the

101
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:26,032
Cambridge University Press Expo Bob
decide to call them the Real Madrid of

102
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,430
economics that works very well on your
paper

103
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:31,131
it doesn't really work go here mom and
what they basically did was come out

104
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,100
with the prioritized list

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,061
and then you ask why economists after
some very happy you asked that question

106
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:41,066
because that's a very good question
plane is course if you wanna know about

107
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:42,104
malaria

108
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:45,093
you ask a malaria expert if you wanna
know about climate you ask a

109
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,121
climatologist

110
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:50,026
British you wanna know which of the two
you should deal with first you can't ask

111
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:51,084
either from

112
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,116
because that's not what they do that is
what economists do

113
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:59,305
they prioritize they make back in and
some ways discussing task Assange

114
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,870
which one should we do first time which
one should we do afterwards

115
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:05,108
so this is the less than this is the one
I'd like to share with you of course you

116
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,102
can also see them website and lost talk
about more I'm sure

117
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:13,004
us that the days goes on they basically
came up with the list where they said

118
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:14,006
they were bad

119
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:17,043
project is a good project where she
investor dollar

120
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,560
you get less than a dollar back when
there's fair project

121
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:23,122
good project and very good project home
course it's a very good project you

122
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:27,119
we should start doing I'm gonna go from
backwoods so that we end up for the best

123
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,308
project these with our project

124
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,860
as you might see but bottom the list was
climate change

125
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:38,235
that this offends a lot of people and
that's probably 01 things what people

126
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:40,580
say I shouldn't come back either

127
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:44,367
and I'd like to talk about that because
that's really curious why is it came up

128
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,150
how are actually worth a try to get back
to this because it's probably one of the

129
00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:49,018
things that will disagree

130
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:53,257
with on the list that you wrote down the
reason why they came up with saying that

131
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,150
killed were doing something more than
cure is a bad deal

132
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,087
it's simply because it's very
inefficient it's not saying that global

133
00:06:58,087 --> 00:06:59,165
warming is not happening it's not saying

134
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:03,127
that is not a big problem but it's
saying that what we can do about it

135
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:07,028
is very little at a very high cost

136
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:10,094
what they basically showers the average
mall macroeconomic models

137
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:15,128
as a Kyoto for everyone agreed will cost
$250 billion dollars a year

138
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,100
as a substantial amount of money that's
two to three times the global

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,087
development aid that we give the third
world every year

140
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,180
yet it would do very little good all
models show postpone warming

141
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:29,084
about six years in 2100 so the guy in
Bangladesh you get flooding 2100 can

142
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,535
wait till 2106

143
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,680
which is a little good but not very much
better me so the idea here really to say

144
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:39,096
will we spent a lot of money doing a
little good and just to give you some to

145
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,153
reference the UN actually

146
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:45,056
estimate that for half that amount for
about $75 billion dollars a year

147
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:48,755
we can solve all major basic problems in
the world we keep it clean drinking

148
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,120
water sanitation basic health care

149
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,074
and education to every single human
being on the planet

150
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:57,111
so we have to ask ourselves do we want
to spend twice the amount and doing very

151
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,028
little good

152
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:02,047
for half the amount undoing an amazing
Monica

153
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,366
and that is really what it comes in bad
projects is not to say

154
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:08,824
if we had all the money in the world we
would want to do it but has to say

155
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:12,780
when we don't it's just simply not our
first priority

156
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:15,086
the fair projects known as I'm not going
to comment on all these public

157
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:18,124
communicable disease a scale a basic
health services just made it

158
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:22,049
simply because yes scale a basic health
services a great thing

159
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:26,049
who do a lot of good but it's also very
very costly again what else is a

160
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:26,628
suddenly

161
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:31,080
we start thinking about both sides in
the question if you look at the project

162
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:35,012
I love sanitation water projects came in
again sentation waters incredibly

163
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:35,971
important

164
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,180
but it also costs a lot of
infrastructure some like to show you the

165
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,036
top four priorities

166
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:43,111
which should be at least the first ones
that we deal with when we talk about how

167
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,019
we should deal with the problems in the
world

168
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:49,260
the fourth-best problem as malaria
dealing with malaria the incident and

169
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,170
Miller's Bab

170
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:54,029
couple billion people can factor with
malaria every year

171
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,728
it might even cost up to what'd
percentage point of GDP

172
00:08:57,989 --> 00:09:01,017
every year for affected nations if we
invested about

173
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:05,286
thirteen billion dollars over the next
four years we could bring Matt incidents

174
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,465
down to half

175
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,670
reconnoiter 500,000 people buying but
perhaps more importantly we can avoid

176
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:13,466
about a billion people getting infected
every year we would significantly

177
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:15,470
increase their ability

178
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:17,916
to deal with many of the other problems
that they have to deal with them of

179
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:18,386
course

180
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,853
in the long run also to deal with global
warming

181
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:26,850
this third best one was for free trade
basically model show that if we could

182
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:29,234
get free trade in specially cut
subsidies in the US

183
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,790
am Europe we could basically enliven the

184
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,085
the global economy to to astounding
number about two thousand four hundred

185
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,484
billion dollars a year

186
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:43,040
half hour which would approve to third
world again the point is to say

187
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:47,033
that we can actually pull two to three
hundred million people out of poverty

188
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:50,410
very radically fastback to 25 years

189
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,700
that would be the third best thing we
could do the second best thing

190
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:57,095
would be the focus amount written not
just malnutrition general

191
00:09:57,329 --> 00:10:00,340
there's a very cheap way of dealing with
malnutrition namely

192
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:04,439
the lack of micronutrients basically
behalf the world's population

193
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:08,482
is lacking in I N Sync ideal environment
a if we in West about $12 billion

194
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,600
dollars we could make a severe

195
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:13,013
in Rose into that problem that would be
the second best investment that we could

196
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:14,045
do

197
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,121
and the very best project would be

198
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,860
to to focus on HIV AIDS basically if we
invest

199
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,725
$27 billion of over the next eight years
we could avoid

200
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,164
28 new million cases have HIV AIDS

201
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,425
again what the stars and what it focuses
on

202
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:35,758
the same they're two very different ways
that we can deal with HIV AIDS wonders

203
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,888
treatment the other one is prevention

204
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:42,348
and again in an ideal world we would do
both but in a world where we don't do

205
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:42,591
either

206
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:46,246
her don't do very well we have to at
least ask ourselves where should we

207
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:47,025
invest first

208
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,803
and treatment as much much more
expensive then prevention so basically

209
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,290
what this focuses on earth

210
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,888
saying we can do a lot more by investing
in prevention basically

211
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,100
for the amount of money that we spend we
can do X amount of good

212
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:04,230
in treatment and ten times as much good
in

213
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,335
prevention so again we focus on as
prevention

214
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,434
rather than treatment a first-rate what
this really does is

215
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,907
that it makes us could think about our
priorities I'd like to

216
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,547
have you look at your priority list and
say did you

217
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,803
get a writer did get close to what we
came up with you

218
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,600
well of course one other things as
climate change again

219
00:11:24,006 --> 00:11:27,475
I find a lot of people find it very very
unlikely that we should do that we

220
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:29,720
should also do climate change

221
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:32,651
if no other reason simply because it's
such a big problem

222
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,351
but of course we don't do all problems
them many problems out there a whirl

223
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:41,882
and what I want to make a shit assure as
if we actually focus on problems

224
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:46,160
that we focus on the right ones the ones
we can do a lot of good rather than a

225
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:46,805
little good

226
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:49,951
and I think actually arm and Thomas
shelling

227
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,230
wanna be a participant from the area and
the dream team he put it very very well

228
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:58,542
one thing's the people forget as in 100
years when we're talking about mostly

229
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,813
climate change impacts will be people
will be much much richer

230
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,401
even the most pessimistic impact
scenarios up the UN estimate that the

231
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:07,585
average person developing world

232
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,470
and 2100 will be about as rich as we are
today

233
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,396
much more likely they will be two to
four times richer

234
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,850
then we are of course will be even
richer than that but the point is

235
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:21,228
to say when we talk about saving people
for helping people

236
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:25,178
in Bangladesh in 2100 we're not talking
about a poor Bangladeshi

237
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:29,480
we're actually talking about really rich
Dutch guy and so the real point of

238
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,207
course is to say

239
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,790
do we wanna spend a lot of money helping
a little

240
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,238
a hundred years now really rich Dutch
guy or do we want to help

241
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:40,980
real pork people right now in Bangladesh

242
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:43,167
really need the help and whom we can
help very very cheaply

243
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:47,071
horse showing put it imagine if you were

244
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:51,301
average passion will be a rich Chinese
are rich bolivian a rich

245
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:55,651
companies in 2100 thinking back in 2005

246
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:01,243
and saying how hard but they can't so
much about helping me

247
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:05,634
a little bit for climate change and
cancer fell a little

248
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,427
about helping my grandfather my great
grandfather

249
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,716
whom they could have helped so much more
and who need it the help

250
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:16,083
so much more so I think that really does
tell us

251
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:19,451
wide as we need to get our priorities
straight even if it does mccord

252
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,350
to the typical way we see this problem
of course that's the

253
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,047
my that's mainly because climate change
has good pictures

254
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:29,696
we have oh yeah the day after tomorrow
have a looks great right

255
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:34,157
the it's a good it's a good film in the
sensor I certainly want to see it right

256
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:38,517
but don't expect Emerick that you know
to cast friend pet owners next movie and

257
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,693
digging latrines in Tanzania something

258
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,827
it just doesn't make for as much a movie
so many ways I think Copenhagen

259
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:45,660
consensus

260
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:49,098
and the whole discussion a priorities as
a defense for pouring problems

261
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:53,110
to make sure that we realize it's not
about making us feel good

262
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,840
it's not about making things that has
the most but media

263
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:02,010
attention but is about making plays as
where we can actually do the most good

264
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,711
the other objections I think that are
important to say is that I'm somehow her

265
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:06,360
we've somehow

266
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,720
positing fossil choice that of course we
should do all things

267
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:13,931
im an ideal world I'd certainly bring I
think we should do all things

268
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,583
but we don't 1970 the developed world

269
00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:20,656
to say that we're gonna spend twice as
much

270
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:24,084
as we did right now them in 1970 on the
developing world

271
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:28,995
since then are aid has hashed so it
doesn't look like we're actually in the

272
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:29,556
path

273
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,074
are suddenly solving all big problems
likewise people also saying but what

274
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:34,600
about the Iraq war

275
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,935
you know we spend a hundred billion
dollars so why don't we spend that I'm

276
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:38,447
doing good in the world

277
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,593
I'm all for that if anyone you guys can
talk bush into doing that that's fine

278
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,850
but the point of course is still to save
you get another 100 billion not

279
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,254
we still wanna spend that in the best
possible way to me

280
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,028
so the real issue here's to get
ourselves back and think about what

281
00:14:52,109 --> 00:14:52,480
other

282
00:14:52,048 --> 00:14:55,837
right priorities I just mentioned
briefly is this really the right list

283
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:57,269
that we got out

284
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,287
you know when you ask the world world's
best economists you

285
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:04,507
inevitably end up asking all white
American men and they're not necessarily

286
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,090
your break power way to work in the
entire world so we actually invited

287
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,727
a young people from all over the world
to come and solve the same problem the

288
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,568
only two requirements worth

289
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,092
that they were studying at the
University and they spoke English

290
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,856
big problem the majority of them were
purse from developing countries

291
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,104
they had all the same material but they
could go basally outside the scope

292
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,040
discussion

293
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,803
and they certainly debt to come up with
their own less than surprising thing was

294
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:33,167
for the list was very someone with
malnutrition and disease is a top on

295
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:34,760
climate change at the bottom

296
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,220
we've done this many other times has
been many as senator seminars and

297
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,751
university students and different things

298
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:43,220
they all come out with a very much the
same up list

299
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:46,251
and that gives me great hope really
insane

300
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:49,522
that I do believe but there's a path for
had to get us

301
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:53,261
to start thinking about priorities and
say what is the important thing in the

302
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:54,350
world

303
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:57,041
cross in an ideal world again we'd love
to do everything

304
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,910
but if we don't do it then we can start
thinking about where should we start

305
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,326
I see the Copenhagen consensus process
we did in 2004 we hope to assemble many

306
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,833
more people

307
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:09,620
getting much better information for 2008
2012

308
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,220
map out the right path for the world but
also to start thinking about political

309
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:14,991
triage

310
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,212
to start thinking about saying let's do
not the things

311
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:21,441
where we can do very little in a very
high-cost not the things that we don't

312
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,642
know how to do

313
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,741
but let's do the great things we can do
an enormous amount of good

314
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,434
a very low cost right now at the end of
the day you can disagree

315
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,910
with the discussion of how we actually
part i sees but we have to be honest and

316
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,040
frank about saying

317
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:38,918
if there's some things we do you there
are other things we don't do if we worry

318
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,544
too much about some things we end up on
the worrying about other things I hope

319
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:42,498
this will help us

320
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:50,389
make better parties and think about how
we better what's

321
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:54,131
would have

322
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:59,106
green ideas work cherished

323
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:07,006
with the carried no importance there was
no back

324
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,141
there is a place for artistic vision is
protected

325
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,330
were inspired design ideas live on
become

326
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,380
ultimate driving machines
